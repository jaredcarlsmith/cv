                <p>I am bent on making a dent in the great resignation and equipping my generation with the tools
                    necessary for them
                    to be successful. Ever since early in high school I have read book after book about how humans can
                    bring more
                    meaning, effectiveness, and joy to their lives individually and in the workplace. In addition to my
                    interest in
                    organizational development I am a web designer and mediator. My plan is to one day live in the
                    Middle East with
                    my family.</p>
